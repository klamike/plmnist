## Signac Workflow Tutorial: MNIST Example using PyTorch Lightning
----------------------------------------------------------

### General Notes

Using `signac` workflows provide the following benefits: 

 - The `signac` workflows provide contained and totally reproducible results, since all the project steps and calculations are contained within this a single `signac` project. Although, to ensure total reproduciblity, the project should be run from a container.  Note: This involves building a container (Docker, Apptainer, Podman, etc.), using it to run the original calculations, and providing it the future parties that are trying to reproduce the exact results.

 - The `signac` workflows can simply track the progress of any project on locally or on the HPC, providing as much or a little details of the project status as the user programs into the `project.py` file. 

 - These `signac` workflows are designed to track the progress of all the project's parts or stages, only resubmitting the jobs locally or to the HPC if they are not completed or not already in the queque.  
 
 - These `signac` workflows also allow colleagues to quickly transfer their workflows to each other, and easily add new state points to a project, without the fear of rerunning the original state points.  

 - Please also see the [signac website](https://signac.io/), which outlines some of the other major features. 


### Overview

This is a `signac` Workflow example/tutorial for a pytorch using plmnist, which utilizes the following workflow steps:

 - **Part 1:** For each individual job (set of state points), this code generates the `signac_job_document.json` file from the `signac_statepoint.json` data.  The `signac_statepoint.json` only stores the set of state points or required variables for the given job.  The `signac_job_document.json` can be used to store any other variables that the user wants to store here for later use or searching. 

- **Part 2:** This downloads the dataset used for the pytorch and plmnist calculations, which will be used to do a calculation/model in `Part 3`.  

- **Part 3:** Run pytorch for the plmnist model without fgsm, using bash command to run a software package inside the commands for each state point. 

- **Part 4:** Run the fgsm on the model from `Part 3`, using bash command to run a software package inside the commands for each state point.  

- **Part 5:** Obtain the average and standard deviation for each input value combination (`num_epochs`, `batch_size`, `hidden_size`, `learning_rate`, `dropout_prob`, `fgsm_epsilon`), with different `seed` values (replicates). The user can add more values at any time via the `init.py` file and rerun only the added value calculations.  The averages and standard deviations accoss the different `seed` values (replicates) are determined for the `test_acc_avg`, `test_acc_std`, `test_loss_avg`, `test_loss_std`, `val_acc_avg`, `val_acc_std`, `val_loss_avg`, `val_loss_std`, `fgsm_acc_avg`, and `fgsm_acc_std` values, and added to the `analysis/output_avg_std_of_seed_txt_filename.txt` file.

#### Notes:
- **src directory:** This directory can be used to store any other custom function that are required for this workflow.  This includes any developed `Python` functions or any template files used for the custom workflow (Example: A base template file that is used for a find and replace function, changing the variables with the differing state point inputs).  

- **templates directory:** This directory is used to store the custom HPC submission scripts and any template files used for the custom workflow (Example: A base template file that is used for a find and replace function, changing the variables with the differing state point inputs).  These find and replace template files could also be put in the `src` directory, but the HPC submission scripts must remain in the `templates` directory.  **All the standard or custom module load commands, conda activate commands, and any other custom items that needed to be HPC submission scripts should in included here for every project (Example: Specific queues, CPU/GPU models, etc.).**

### Installation

These signac workflows "this project" can be built using conda:

#### Install the main signac packages:
```bash
cd signac_pytorch_plmnist_example
```
##### For CPU only installations:
```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

##### For GPU installations:
```bash
conda env create --file cuda_environment.yml
```

##### Activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda activate plmnist
```

#### Install the plmnist package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Run the Workflow Locally

All commands in this section are run from the `<local_path>/signac_pytorch_plmnist_example/signac_pytorch_plmnist_example/project` directory.

This can be done at the start of a new project, but is not always required. If you moved the directory after starting a project or signac can not find the path correctly, you will need to run the following command (`signac init`) from the `project` directory:

```bash
signac init
```

Initialize all the state points for the jobs (generate all the separate folders with the same variables).  
 - Note: This command generates the `workspace` folder, which includes a sub-folder for each state point (different variable combinations),  These sub-folders are numbered uniquely based of the state point values.  The user can add more state points via the `init.py` file at any time, running the below command to create the new state points files and sub-folders that are in the `init.py` file.

 ```bash
python init.py
```

Check the status of your project (i.e., what parts are completed and what parts are available to be run).

```bash
python project.py status
```

Run `all available jobs for the whole project` locally with the `run` command.  Note: Using the run command like this will run all parts of the projects until completion.  Note: This feature is not available when submitting to HPCs.

```bash
python project.py run
```

Run all available `part 1` sections of the project locally with the `run` command.

```bash
python project.py run -o part_1_initialize_signac_command
```

Run all available `part 2` sections of the project locally with the `run` command.

```bash
python project.py run -o part_2_download_data_command
```

Run all available `part 3` sections of the project locally with the `run` command.

```bash
python project.py run -o part_3_train_and_test_command
```

Run all available `part 4` sections of the project locally with the `run` command.

```bash
python project.py run -o part_4_fgsm_attack_command
```

Run all available `part 5` sections of the project locally with the `run` command.

```bash
python project.py run -o part_5_seed_analysis_command
```

Additionally, you can run the following flags for the  `run` command, controlling the how the jobs are executed on the local machine (does not produce HPC job submission scripts):
- `--parallel 2` : This only works this way when using `run`. This runs several jobs in parallel (2 in this case) at a time on the local machine.
 - See the `signac` [documenation](https://docs.signac.io/en/latest/) for more information, features, and the [Project Command Line Interface](https://docs.signac.io/projects/flow/en/latest/project-cli.html).


### Submit the Workflow Jobs to an HPC.  

All commands in this section are run from the `<local_path>/signac_pytorch_plmnist_example/signac_pytorch_plmnist_example/project` directory.

First, you need to be sure that the `templates/phoenix.sh` or the used HPC template file is correct for the given HPC.  Additionally, the `templates/phoenix.sh` file is correct for the given HPC in the `project.py` file, specifically it is setup for  the `DefaultSlurmEnvironment` (only for a Slurm enviroment), and the class for it is set properly (Example: `class Phoenix(DefaultSlurmEnvironment):`).  

Second, in general, the `signac labels` (Example: `@Project.label` in the `project.py` file) that check the status of each workflow part should not be written in a way that is computationally expensive, removing the need to run an interactive job on the HPC when using the `signac status` command.  Otherwise, you need to run an interactive job when using the `signac status` command on the HPC, as it will be computationally expensive. 

This can be done at the start of a new project, but is not always required. If you moved the directory after starting a project or signac can not find the path correctly, you will need to run the following command (`signac init`) from the `project` directory:

```bash
signac init
```

Initialize all the state points for the jobs (generate all the separate folders with the different state points).  
 - Note: This command generates the `workspace` folder, which includes a sub-folder for each state point (different variable combinations),  These sub-folders are numbered uniquely based of the state point values.  The user can add more state points via the `init.py` file at any time, running the below command to create the new state points files and sub-folders that are in the `init.py` file.

 ```bash
python init.py
```

Check the status of your project (i.e., what parts are completed and what parts are available to be submitted).

```bash
python project.py status
```

Submit `all the currently available jobs` to the HPC with the `submit` command.

```bash
python project.py submit
```

Submit all available `part 1` sections of the project to the HPC with the `submit` command.

```bash
python project.py submit -o part_1_initialize_signac_command
```

Submit all available `part 2` sections of the project to the HPC with the `submit` command.

```bash
python project.py submit -o part_2_download_data_command
```

Submit all available `part 3` sections of the project to the HPC with the `submit` command.

```bash
python project.py submit -o part_3_train_and_test_command
```
Submit all available `part 4` sections of the project to the HPC with the `submit` command.

```bash
python project.py submit -o part_4_fgsm_attack_command
```

Submit all available `part 5` sections of the project to the HPC with the `submit` command.

```bash
python project.py submit -o part_5_seed_analysis_command
```

Additionally, you can run the following flags for the `submit` command, controlling the how the jobs are submitted to the HPC:
 - `--bundle 2` : Only available when using `submit`.  This bundles multiple jobs (2 in this case) into a single run or HPC submittion script, auto adjusting the time, CPU cores, etc., based on the total command selections.
  - `--pretend` : Only available when using `submit`.  This is used to output what the submission script will look like, without submitting it to the HPC. 
  - `--parallel` : This only works this way when using `submit`.  The `N` value in `--parallel N` is not read; therefore, it only runs all the jobs in a HPC submittion script at the same time (in parallel), auto adjusting some variables.
  - See the `signac` [documenation](https://docs.signac.io/en/latest/) for more information, features, and the [Project Command Line Interface](https://docs.signac.io/projects/flow/en/latest/project-cli.html).
  
  `Warning`, the user should always confirm the job submission to the HPC is working properly before submitting jobs using the `--pretend` flag, especially when using `--parallel` and `--bundle`.  This may involve programming the correct items in the custom HPC submission script (i.e., the files in the `templates` folder) as needed to make it work for their unique setup.
